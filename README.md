# AdaClassNotes
My class notes from Ada!

If you're perusing these, please note that my notes are a combination of Ada's official notes and my own commentary. As a result, there could be things in here that are inaccurate or incomplete. 

At first, I didn't copy Ada's notes into my own docs, so the early docs are pretty short. Later, I started copying the Ada notes into my doc first, then adding my own edits/comments/clarifications.
